booklib
============

Servlet/SpringMVC demo web application written mostly in Kotlin

Uses H2 as DB and AWS S3 for file hosting.
Uses Freemarker as presentational engine.
Uses "lean" embedded Jetty (so that certain modules are excluded, for example there is no module for JSP support as this project doesn't make any use of JSPs).
